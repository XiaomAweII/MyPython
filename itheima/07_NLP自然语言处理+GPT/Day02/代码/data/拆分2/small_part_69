by manga entertainment controversy over the years manga entertainment has been the subject of many complaints from western anime fans a frequent complaint is that their name is inaccurate and possibly even ignorant of japanese culture manga technically refers to printed japanese comics rather than animation however even in japanese the word is often used to refer to both printed and animated material in the same way as the english word cartoon some have accused manga of trying to market anime as exploiation movies by focusing on pornography and ultra violence many of their releases have become infamous for their content such as legend of the overfiend a hentai series more vocal critics even blame manga for giving japanese animation a bad reputation in certain parts of the west in the mid one nine nine zero s media controversy over overfiend particularly in the daily mail newspaper caused a crash in the uk anime market leading to companies such as pioneer entertainment now geneon pulling out of the uk market the company have often been accused of tampering with the material they distribute changes have included replacing the original japanese soundtrack with rock music dumbing down translated dialogue and creating dubs with added profanity this has declined over time but re releases of older shows still contain edits their dvd releases have often contained errors for example the audio track of ghost in the shell was not properly synchronized their uk macross plus discs were mislabelled and their release of the end of evangelion contained bugs that made it incompatible with some dvd players they frequently make mistakes with releases such as forgetting to add english subtitles to go with japanese dialogue notable on all the region two uk releases of

educators are concerned with the development of tools that facilitate practice and or the study of practice mathematics education has been a hotly debated subject in modern society there is an ambiguity in the term for it refers both to these practices in classrooms around the world but also to an emergent discipline with its own journals conferences etc the main international body involved is the international commission on mathematical instruction history elementary mathematics was part of the education system in most ancient civilisations including ancient greece the roman empire vedic society and ancient egypt in most cases a formal education was only available to male children with a sufficiently high status wealth or caste in plato s division of the liberal arts into the trivium and the quadrivium the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of arithmetic and geometry this structure was continued in the structure of classical education that was developed in medieval europe teaching of geometry was almost universally based on euclid s elements apprentices to trades such as masons merchants and money lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession the first mathematics textbooks to be written in english were published by robert recorde beginning with the grounde of artes in one five four zero in the renaissance the academic status of mathematics declined because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce although it continued to be taught in european universities it was seen as subservient to the study of natural metaphysical and moral philosophy this trend was somewhat reversed in the seventeenth century with the university of aberdeen creating a mathematics chair in one six one three followed by the chair in geometry set up in university of oxford in one six one nine and the lucasian chair of mathematics established by the university of cambridge in one six six two however it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities isaac newton for example received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined trinity college cambridge in one six six one in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the industrial revolution led to an enormous increase in urban populations basic numeracy skills such as the ability to tell the time count money and carry out simple arithmetic became essential in this new urban lifestyle within the new public education systems mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age by the twentieth century mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all developed countries however diverse and changing ideas about the purpose of mathematical education led to little overall consistency in the content or methods that were adopted objectives at different times and in different cultures and countries mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives these objectives have included the teaching of basic numeracy skills to all pupils the teaching of practical mathematics arithmetic elementary algebra plane and solid geometry trigonometry to most pupils to equip them to follow a trade or craft the teaching of abstract mathematical concepts such as set and function at an early age the teaching of selected areas of mathematics such as euclidean geometry as an example of an axiomatic system and a model of deductive reasoning the teaching of selected areas of mathematics such as calculus as an example of the intellectual achievements of the modern world the teaching of advanced mathematics to those pupils who wish to follow a career in science the teaching of heuristics and other problem solving strategies to solve nonroutine problems methods of teaching mathematics have varied in line with changing objectives standards throughout most of history standards for mathematics education were set locally by individual schools or teachers depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to and realistic for their pupils in modern times there has been a move towards regional or national standards usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum in england for example standards for mathematics education are set as part of the national curriculum for england in the usa the national council of teachers of mathematics has produced a series of documents most recently principles and standards for school mathematics setting forth a consensus on broad goals for school mathematics more specific education standards are generally set at a state level in california for example the california state board of education sets standards for mathematics education levels different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age as a special or honors class a rough guide to the ages at which the sub topics of arithmetics and algebra are taught is as follows addition ages five seven more digits ages eight nine subtraction ages five seven more digits ages eight nine multiplication ages seven eight more digits ages nine one zero division age eight more digits ages nine one zero pre algebra ages one one one two algebra ages one three geometry ages one four one five precalculus ages one six calculus ages one seven methods the method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve methods of teaching mathematics include the following classical education the teaching of mathematics within the classical education syllabus of the middle ages was typically based on euclid s elements which was taught as a paradigm of deductive reasoning rote learning the teaching of mathematical results definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically used to teach multiplication tables exercises the teaching of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type such as adding vulgar fractions or solving quadratic equations for example cuisenaire rods are used as a method of teaching fractions problem solving the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity creativity and heuristic thinking by setting students open ended unusual and sometimes insoluble problems the problems can range from simple word problems to problems from international mathematics competitions such as the international mathematical olympiad new math a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as set theory rather than practical applications historical method teaching the development of mathematics within an historical social and cultural context provides more human interest than a purely abstract approach reform based on the constructivism learning theory students usually work on contextual problems in small groups with the problems themselves acting as vehicles for mathematics content the use of calculator and manipulatives are encouraged but algebra skills and rote memorization are deemphasized these methods are not exclusive and any given system of mathematical education will probably combine several different methods mathematics teachers the following people all taught mathematics at some stage in their lives although they are better known for other things lewis

eastern foothills of the ouachita mountains in saline county arkansas the river has three sections the middle fork the alum fork and the north fork which merge north of the city of benton arkansas the upper section of the saline is a clear cold water stream with a series of fast running shoals interspersed with quiet pools the central section of the river has clear to murky water with long slower moving pools interrupted by short stretches of fast water the lower section is sluggish with murky water during parts of the year the lower stretches of the river can be somewhat clogged with brush or trees after the merge of the three forks the river flattens and travels through grant cleveland bradley and ashley counties the river empties into the ouachita river in the felsenthal national

christianity for the error of jewish will worship hist eccles vi one two he was the largest serapion in antioch lastly eusebius quotes vi one two two from a pamphlet serapion wrote concerning the docetic gospel of peter in which serapion presents an argument to the christian community of rhossus in syria against this gospel and condemns it we brethren receive peter and the other apostles even as christ but the writings that go falsely by their names we in our experience reject knowing that such things as these we never received when i was with you i supposed you all to be attached to the right faith and so without going through the gospel put forward under peter s name i said if this is all that makes your petty quarrel why then let it be read but now that i have learned from information given me that their mind was lurking in some hole of heresy i will make a point of coming to you again so brethren expect me speedily knowing then brethren of what kind of heresy was marcion from others who used this very gospel i mean from the successors of those who started it whom we call docetae for most of its ideas are of their school from them i say i borrowed it and was able to go through it and to find that most of it belonged to the right teaching of the saviour but some things were additions eusebius also alludes to a number of personal letters serapion wrote to pontius caricus and others about this gospel of peter serapion also acted against the influence of gnosticism in osroene by consecrating palut as bishop of edessa where palut addressed the

st serapion syriacs two one one deaths ancient roman christianity patriarchs of antioch irritation in biology and physiology is a state of over excitation or hyper reactivity a stimulus or agent which induces the state of irritation is an irritant irritants are typically thought of as chemical agents for example phenol and capsaicin but mechanical thermal heat and radiative stimuli for example ultraviolet light or ionising radiations can also cause irritation irritation in organisms in higher organisms the allergic response may be cause of irritation an allergen is defined distinctly from an irritant however as allergy requires a specific interaction with the immune system and is thus dependent on the possibly unique sensitivity of the organism involved while an irritant classically acts in a non specific manner in humans it is a mild form of suffering often with anger about this in particular if applicable anger at the person who caused it this can also be oneself e g when forgetting something or doing something one deems to be stupid it is a form of stress but conversely if one is stressed by unrelated matters mild imperfections can cause more irritation than usual one is irritable see also sensitivity human in more basic organisms assigning irritation the status of pain is the perception of the being stimulated which is not observable although it may be shared see gate control theory of pain it is not proven that oysters can feel pain but we do know that they react to irritation when an irritating object becomes trapped within an oyster s shell it deposits layers of calcium carbonate caco three slowly increasing in size and producing a pearl this serves no purpose to the oyster pearls do not attract mates for the oyster or perform any other funtion it seems impossible to find an evolutionary advantage for the ability to produce the pearl thus it can be explained only as a reaction to an irritation we can also observe that an amoeba avoids being prodded with a pin but we do not have enough evidence to suggest how much it feels this irritation is apparently the only universal sense shared by even single celled creatures it is postulated that most such beings also feel pain but this is a projection empathy some philosophers notably ren descartes denied it entirely even for such higher mammals as dogs or primates like monkeys to him intelligence was a pre requisite to even the feeling of pain mating mating is a fascinating example of the complexity that can arise in considering irritation males generally pursue females in mating species females avoid males that they assume are undesirable or at bad times to bear young thus the physical aspects of sexual pursuit may irritate the female and the pursuit may itself be an irritation this changes when a desirable male approaches at the right time at least insofar as the female considers it to be so so something which is an irritation at one time may serve a purpose or even be a pleasure at another for these reasons mating is very often omitted from any discussion of irritation itself and indeed prevents problems for discussions of pain and pleasure itself mating often involves both and certainly motherhood also involves a great number of irritations but with the third party observed advantage of passing on genes that is if one accepts that this is of any use

purchased by gene autry and named the los angeles angels on december one nine one nine six zero finley purchased a controlling interest in the kansas city athletics from johnson s estate johnson died in march of that year he bought out the minority owners a year later finley quickly started to turn the franchise around refusing to make deals with the new york yankees and searching for unheralded talent after being told by manager ed lopat about the yankees success being attributable to the dimensions of yankee stadium he built the k c pennant porch in right field which brought the right field fence in kansas city municipal stadium to match yankee stadium s dimensions exactly league officials forced him to move the fences back after two exhibition games finley then ordered a white line to be painted on the field at the original pennant porch distance and ordered the public address announcer to tell the crowd that would have been a home run in yankee stadium whenever a fly ball was hit past that line the practice was quickly abandoned after the announcer was calling more would be home runs for the opposition than the a s he also started micromanaging the team ordering players to change their style of play and firing any manager or releasing any player who publicly disagreed with him he replaced the a s traditional elephant mascot with charlie o a live mule and paraded him about the outfield and even into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies and into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters when third baseman sal bando departed the team as a free agent and was asked if it was difficult to leave the athletics bando responded was it hard to leave the titanic the mule died in one nine seven six at age two zero finley also made changes to the team s uniforms in one nine six three finley changed the team s colors to kelly green fort knox gold and wedding gown white in one nine six seven he replaced the team s traditional black cleats with white

and vida blue to the yankees bowie kuhn decided to invoke the rarely used best interests of baseball clause in order to void finely s sales finley in turn hired famed sports attorney neil papiano and proceeded to file a a one zero million dollar restraint of trade lawsuit against kuhn and major league baseball this lawsuit is widely recognized as one of the most famous influential and precident setting sports related cases in the history of american jurisprudence finley was in the process of rebuilding the team again in one nine eight one when he sold the team to walter a haas jr president of levi strauss catfish and blue moon even fabricating boyhood stories about hunter to give him press appeal finley refused to sign then prospect and future hall of famer don sutton to a contract simply because sutton didn t have a flashy nickname he introduced ball girls one of whom the future debbie fields went on to found mrs fields original cookies inc and advocated night games for the world series to increase fan interest finley also was an outspoken advocate of the designated hitter rule which he pushed until it was adopted by the american league he suggested many other innovations that were tried and rejected for various reasons including orange baseballs tried in a few exhibition games hitters found it too hard to pick up the spin a three ball walk and two strike strikeout tried in spring training one year he thought it would lead to games with more action instead the result was more walks and longer games a mechanical rabbit that would pop up behind home plate and deliver new balls to the umpire finley installed one which he named harvey at the a s home ballparks in kansas city and oakland but the idea never caught on anywhere else and was dropped by the a s after one nine six nine a designated runner this idea was rejected for several reasons by major league baseball but it didn t stop finley from experimenting on his own in one nine seven four hiring a college sprinter named herb washington exclusively to pinch run and steal bases washington stole two nine bases but was caught stealing one eight times and frequently picked off by opposing pitchers he was let go after only one season depite these gimmicks and various other promotions during finley s ownership of the athletics the a s were a mediocre draw at best during the two zero

atmospheric pressure uses several therapeutic principles are made use of in hbot the increased overall pressure is of therapeutic value when hbot is used in the treatment of decompression sickness for many other conditions the therapeutic principle of hbot lies in a drastically increased partial pressure of oxygen in the tissues of the body the oxygen partial pressures achievable under hbot are much higher than those under breathing pure oxygen at normobaric conditions i e at normal atmospheric pressure a related effect is the increased oxygen transport capacity of the blood under atmospheric pressure oxygen transport is limited by the oxygen binding capacity of red blood cells and very little oxygen is transported by blood plasma because the hemoglobin of the red blood cells is almost saturated with oxygen under atmospheric pressure this route of transport can not be exploited any further oxygen transport by plasma however is significantly increased under hbot the main indications for hbot are certain non healing wounds post surgical or diabetic radiation soft tissue necrosis and radiation osteonecrosis necrotizing fasciitis flesh eating bacteria carbon monoxide poisoning decompression sickness severe infection by anaerobic bacteria such as gas gangrene air or gas embolism severe uncorrected anemia chronic refractory osteomyelitis enhancement of healing in problem wounds sports injuries hbot is recognized by conventional medicine in the usa as an appropriate treatment for about one four conditions however alternative healing advocates of many stripes believe it is useful for many additional conditions among the off label uses of hbot are use as a therapy for brain healing as in stroke dementia cerebral palsy and for some infectious conditions such as lyme disease and post polio syndrome hbot is quite expensive with a session costing one zero zero to six zero zero in the usa in the uk most chambers are financed by the national health service but there are non profit hbot chambers such as those run by multiple sclerosis therapy centres the traditional chamber the traditional type of hbot chamber is a hard shelled pressure vessel such chambers can be run at absolute pressures up to six zero zero kilopascals or eight five lbf in navies diving organizations and hospitals typically operate these they range in size from those that are portable and capable of transporting just one patient to those that are fixed very heavy and capable of treating eight or more patients the chamber may consist of a pressure vessel that is generally made of steel aluminium with the view ports windows or hull made of acrylic one or more human entry hatches theses could be small and circular or wheel in type hatches for patients on trolleys an airlock allowing human entry a separate chamber with two hatches one to the outside world and one to the main chamber which can be independently pressurised to allow patients to enter or exit the main chamber while it is still pressurised an airlock allowing medicines instruments and food to enter the main chamber glass ports or closed circuit television allowing the technicians and medical staff outside the chamber to monitor the inside of the chamber an intercom allowing two way communications inside and outside the chamber a carbon dioxide scrubber consisting of a fan that passes the gas inside the chamber through a soda lime canister a control panel outside the chamber is used to open and close valves allowing air to enter or leave the chamber and oxygen to be supplied to masks in larger multiplace chambers both patients and medical staff inside the chamber breathe from individual oxygen masks which supply pure oxygen and remove the exhaled gas from the chamber during treatment patients breathe oxygen most of the time but have periodic air breaks to minimise the risk of oxygen toxicity the exhaled gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the build up of oxygen which could provoke a fire medical staff may also breathe oxygen to reduce the risk of decompression sickness the masks that are used may simply cover the mouth and nose or they may be a type of flexible transparent helmet with a seal around the neck the pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing high pressure air to enter from storage cylinders similar to diving cylinders a gas compressor is used to fill these cylinders a recompression chamber for a single diving casualty smaller monoplace chambers can only accommodate the patient no medical staff can enter the chamber is flooded with pure oxygen and the patient does not wear an oxygen mask or helmet patients inside the chamber will notice discomfort inside their ears as a pressure difference develops between their middle ear and the chamber atmosphere this can be relieved by the valsalva maneouvre or by jaw wiggling as the pressure increase further mist may form in the air inside the chamber and the air may become warm when the patient speaks the tone of the voice may increase to the level that they sound like cartoon characters to reduce the pressure a valve is opened to allow gas out of the chamber as the pressure falls the patient s ears may squeak as the pressure inside the ear equalizes with the chamber the temperature in the chamber will cool chambers for home treatment there are portable hbot chambers which are often used for home treatment these are usually referred to as mild chambers which is a reference to the lower maximum pressure of soft sided chambers those commercially available in the usa go up to four one psi which is equivalent to a water depth of one one ft these chambers are typically not operated with one zero zero oxygen as the breathing gas therefore they do not fit the actual definition of hyperbaric oxygen but are more appropriately defined as being compressed air therapy these chambers were originally developed and used for altitude sickness which is a valid application the benefits of hbot to a number of other off label conditions such as lyme disease cancer stroke cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis cardiac conditions brain injury autism and other immune disorders have yet to be substantiated by research historical link to diving initially hbot was developed as a treatment for diving disorders involving bubbles of gas in the tissues such as decompression sickness and gas embolism the chamber cures decompression sickness and gas embolism in several ways the increase in pressure in the chamber reduces the size of the gas bubbles improving transport of blood to tissues downstream of the bubbles the high concentrations of oxygen breathed by the casualty are beneficial in keeping oxygen starved tissues alive the high concentrations of oxygen in the tissues have the effect of removing the nitrogen from the bubble making it smaller until it consists only of oxygen which is re absorbed into the body bubbles are eventually eliminated by long exposure to pressure and high oxygen concentrations allowing a gradual reduction of pressure back to atmospheric levels treatments the slang term for a cycle of pressurization inside the hbo chamber is a dive emergency hbot for diving disorders typically follows one of these two forms for most cases a shallow dive to a pressure the equivalent of one eight metres six zero feet of water for three to four five hours with the casualty breathing pure oxygen with air breaks every two zero minutes to reduce oxygen toxicity for extremely serious cases a deeper dive to a pressure the equivalent of three seven metres one two two feet of water for four five hours with the casualty breathing air in canada and the united states the u s navy dive charts are used to determine the duration pressure and breathing gas of the therapy the most frequently used tables are table five and table six in the uk the royal navy six two and six seven tables are used an hbot treatment for longer term conditions is often a series of two zero to four zero dives the undersea and hyperbaric medical society uhms publishes a committee report which compiles the latest research findings and contains information regarding the recommended duration and pressure of the longer term conditions complications there are risks associated with hbot similar to some diving disorders pressure changes can cause a squeeze or barotrauma in the tissues surrounding trapped air inside the body such as the lungs behind the eardrum inside paranasal sinuses or even trapped underneath dental fillings breathing high pressure oxygen for long periods can causes oxygen toxicity one of the side effects
